# Machine-learning-LAB-02
The objective of this lab is to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on
the Titanic dataset to:
1. Understand the structure and basic features of the dataset.
2. Perform Univariate Analysis to study individual variables.
3. Conduct Bivariate Analysis to examine relationships between two variables.
4. Explore Multivariate Analysis to identify patterns involving multiple variables.
5. Visualize data effectively using various plots and derive actionable insights.
By the end of this lab, you will have a thorough understanding of the dataset and its
underlying patterns.
